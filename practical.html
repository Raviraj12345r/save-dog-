        Visit an animal shelter, or rescue, just once and <br> you will realize the importance of adopting these animals. Many <br> are surrendered by family who are unable to provide for them, or who simply  <br>do not want them any longer. Some bare strays. <br> And of course there are stories that I just don’t want to get into. <br> Sometimes animals go through abuse that is completely unimaginable. But it’s <br>never their fault. Putting words to some of the <br> images I’ve captured at our local Humane Society, the Humane Society of Marathon County,  <br>have been some of my favorite “Dogizms” to create. It’s my <br> hope that they will be shared and inspire someone to visit a shelter. <br> Who knows, maybe they will fall in love with a furry face and become a family!

        “A lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.” - Barack Obama <br>
        
        “Do not pity a shelter dog. Adopt one.” <br>
        
        “Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I wag my tail again?” <br>

            “Dogs have a way of finding the people who need them, and filling the emptiness we didn’t <br> ever know we had.” - Thom Jones <br>

“You can’t change a dog’s past, but you could rewrite his future.” <br>

“Can you tell me the story about how you rescued me again?” <br>

“Some people see an unfortunate dog sitting in a shelter. I see an angel someone threw away.” <br>

“Everybody should have a shelter dog. It’s good for the soul.” - Paul Shaffer <br>

“Saving on dog will not change the world, but surely for that one dog, <br> the world will change forever.” - Karen Davison <br>
